## FrontEnd Repo Details




## Installation
1. Create a GMail account (You may use your current GMail but not it's not recommended because you will need to turn off 2 Factor Authentication, which makes your account less secure).
2. Login to your GMail account and and make sure "Allow less secure apps" is turned "ON":



## Troubleshooting steps for GMail accounts
If you run the code from an unfamiliar device or from an IP of a different country, Google might block you immediately from logging in. To resolve that, follow the following steps:
1. Sign in to your new GMail account from your browser.
2. Go on to [https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha).
3. Click on the "Continue" button to allow access.
4. Try using the application again.
